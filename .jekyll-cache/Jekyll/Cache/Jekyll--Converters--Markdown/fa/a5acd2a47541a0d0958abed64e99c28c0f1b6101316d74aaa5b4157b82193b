<p><em>Design for Uprising</em> was my masters thesis at Harvard GSD, exploring the role of planning and design in the events of the 2015 Baltimore Uprising. The project developed a geospatial dataset through qualitative analysis of tweets sent during the uprising, and analyzed that data using GIS and OLS regressions against urban design and planning factors (such as street width, street wall, network proximities, and more). The goal was to give future planners an understanding of how they can support similar uprisings. Though it produced some interesting insights, I didnâ€™t meet that lofty goal.</p>
