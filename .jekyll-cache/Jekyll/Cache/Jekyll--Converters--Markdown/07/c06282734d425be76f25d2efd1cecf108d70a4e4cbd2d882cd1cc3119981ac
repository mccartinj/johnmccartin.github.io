<p>A housing plan for Lynn, MA, a community central in Bostonâ€™s housing crisis, international migration patterns, and American reactionary politics. This plan prioritizes those most impacted by the housing crisis and the threat of substandard living conditions and displacement. This process was a hybrid of in-person and digital engagement conducted through the pandemic, and included dual language public fora conducted on Zoom and simulcast on YouTube live.</p>
