<ul>
  <li>New Times Aggregator is a neo-web-1.0, wordpress-based system for easy, human-led aggregation of local news stories, local events, and non-network advertising. New Times is inspired by the legacy of alt weeklies and experiments like New Models. The system includes a wordpress theme and plugin. This is very much a work-in-progress, but itâ€™s an idea Iâ€™d like to take farther.</li>
