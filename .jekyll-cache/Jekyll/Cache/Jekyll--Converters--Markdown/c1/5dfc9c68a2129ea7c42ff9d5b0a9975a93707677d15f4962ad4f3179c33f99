<p>Vision Haverhill 2035 is a master plan for this city of 64,000. Using data analysis and public engagement, the process set goals across six focus areas and proposed design- and development- based actions that could acheive those goals. Haverhill adopted the plan and passed zoning to implement the plan in 2020. I managed the process (including the existing conditions analysis, early public engagement, and creative direction for the plan) before leaving Utile to join MAPC.</p>
