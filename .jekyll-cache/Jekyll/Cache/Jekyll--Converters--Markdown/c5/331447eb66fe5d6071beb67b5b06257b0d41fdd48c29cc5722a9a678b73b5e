<p>Imagine Salem is an ongoing initiative by the City of Salem, MA to address its planning needs. In 2017, Utile helped kick off this initiative by producing a vision plan for the city’s community, housing, economy, and transportation. I was the primary analyst on the plan, directed or produced the data visualizations, and served as the principal writer for the vision plan (called the “progress report”).</p>
