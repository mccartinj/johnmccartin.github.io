<p><em>From the Vomitorium</em> is a series of pieces for sampler. The pieces themselves are given as graphic scores and open to interpretation. The sampler has been modified to be both difficult and a little dangerous to play. From the Vomitorium was displayed at Shed Show #1 in Poughkeepsie, NY.</p>
