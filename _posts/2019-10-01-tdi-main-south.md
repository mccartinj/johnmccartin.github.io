# TDI Worcester Main South

In 2019, MassDevelopment’s TDI program added a new district in Worcester’s Main South neighborhood, an historically disadvantaged and majority-BIPOC neighborhood near Clark University. Utile was brought in to analyze the existing streetscape, engage neighborhood residents and business owners on their vision for the area, assess the options for several vacant parcels, and develop pilot street activation programs. I managed the project through its initial stages, before leaving Utile.
