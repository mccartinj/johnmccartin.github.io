# Melrose Housing Production Plan

A housing plan for the City of Melrose, MA under M.G.L. Chapter 40B. This process was nearly 100% virtual, conducted via zoom and qualtrics. I managed the project, analyzed most of the data, produced the public engagement events, and wrote the first draft of the report before leaving MAPC.
