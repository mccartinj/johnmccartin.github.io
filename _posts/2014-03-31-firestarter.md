# Web Boilerplates

This was a suite of technologies I developed to quickly deploy sites at work and for fun. Ring of Fire is an object-oriented CSS library (written in scss) that extends Yahooâ€™s [PureCSS](https://purecss.io/) framework. Firestarter and Silencio are WordPress boilerplate themes that implement Ring of Fire. Firejekyll is a boilerplate jekyll theme that implements Ring of Fire. None of these projects are actively maintained, though all are still in use.
