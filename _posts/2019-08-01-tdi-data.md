# TDI Data Collection and Presentation Tool

MassDevelopmentâ€™s TDI program commissioned Utile to build an internal tool for data collection and presentation on investments and business activity in TDI districts. To develop the tool, we held listening and UX testing workshops with TDI fellows and designed several iterations of the tool to meet evolving client needs. My role on the project was to co-design the UX workshops, develop UX prototypes in pug and javascript, co-design and manage the data model, and generally liaise between the planning and engineering teams.
