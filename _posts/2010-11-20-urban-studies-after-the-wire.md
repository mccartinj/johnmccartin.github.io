This was a mini-course on HBO’s _The Wire_, urban political theory, and the power of visual representation. Students watched Season 3 Episode 1 and were given a series of readings, followed by three lectures and discussions. The course was taught as part of Vassar’s Intro to Urban Studies Spring 2011 course.
