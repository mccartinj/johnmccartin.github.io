# GIS for Architecture course

I developed_ GIS for Architecture_, a graduate elective at the Wentworth School of Department of Architecture. The course covered technical aspects of GIS, specific ArcGIS workflows, the history and politics of cartography, and alternative approaches to GIS (and tech generally) pointed to by afrofuturism, xenofeminism, and big data discourses.
