# Little Castles Revisited

*Little Castles Revisited* explores the power and politics of color in Formstone, an iconic, adaptive, everyday architectural feature of Baltimore's rowhouse landscape.

Written for Saturated Space â€“ the colour research cluster at the Architectural Association in London.
