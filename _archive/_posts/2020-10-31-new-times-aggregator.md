# New Times Aggregator CMS

* New Times Aggregator is a neo-web-1.0, wordpress-based system for easy, human-led aggregation of local news stories, local events, and non-network advertising. New Times is inspired by the legacy of alt weeklies and contemporary indexing experiments. The system includes a wordpress theme and plugin. This is very much a work-in-progress, but it’s an idea I’d like to take farther.
* Code: theme | plugin
* [Example site](http://phillyindex.co/)
