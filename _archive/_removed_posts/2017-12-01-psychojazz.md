# Psychojazz

This is a collaborative music performance tool that I built for me and my friends when we were living apart. The app loads html5/javascript-based synths, and the entire screen space becomes an instrument. When you play, the sounds is heard by everyone on the site.

The approach to UX leads to a lot of indeterminacy, which is pretty good experimental tunes. The name is a reference to the band Wolf Eyes. They're good.

**Veeery much in development.** In the future, users can build their own synths to load into the room and users will be able to have private rooms.

Tech: Node, Express, MongoDB, Pug, SCSS, jQuery, Websockets
