# Work It! Revere

*Work It! Revere* is a plan for community-driven economic development in Revere, Massachusetts. The project addresses the NECCO candy factory, which sits on a large site between downtown Revere and the bustling Shirley Ave district. We call for a mix of contemporary production facilities and neighborhood amenities, as well as a rich array of urban design improvements.
