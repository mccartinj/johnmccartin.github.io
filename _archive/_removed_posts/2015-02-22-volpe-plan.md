# Redesigning Cambridge's Volpe Center
A new design for the federal government's Volpe Center site in Cambridge, MA's Kendall Square. This plan concentrates existing research uses in one facility, while creating new housing, commercial, and commuinty spaces. The historic street grid is redrawn through the site and moments in the neighborhood's past are given new meaning for the city's new residents.
