# Arlington Fair Housing Action Plan

A fair housing plan for the Town of Arlington, MA, an inner core suburb close to Cambridge and Downtown Boston. This plan meets the requirements of a federal “Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing,” but it has the spirit of an “Assessment of Fair Housing” under AFFH regulations. I was involved with the project as an analyst from the start, and took over project management at the project’s end. MAPC worked with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law to develop the plan.
